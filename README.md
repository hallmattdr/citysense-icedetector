# CitySense Ice Detector
ENGR 100:190 Final Project
*– Matt Hall, Lucas Wells, Clara James-Heer, Lilly McCreedy*

## Project Details
All project information including our research, project proposal, and design choices can be found on my [website](hallmattdr.wixsite.com/home/ice-detector). This document will focus on the hardware requirements and code for the device.

## Hardware Requirements
This code is designed to work specifically with the hardware we chose for our prototype. We specifically picked parts with budget considerations and compatibility in mind.
* Embedded System: [RaspberryPi](link)
* Thermal Camera: TODO
* IR Sensor: TODO

Our prototype used a tupperware container for the enclosure, but anything somewhat weather-proof could work.
Additionally, you'll need a portable charger. The Raspberry Pi is a very efficient system, so you can get away with a very small capacity battery. We got 10+ hours out of a (TODO)mAh portable charger.
